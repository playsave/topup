# Mastering Herta: A Comprehensive Guide to The Best Herta Build in Honkai: Star Rail

Herta, the eccentric genius and owner of the Herta Space Station, twirls her way into battles in Honkai: Star Rail as a versatile Ice element character specializing in Area-of-Effect (AoE) damage and powerful follow-up attacks. While often overlooked by players focusing on limited 5-stars, a well-optimized **the Herta build** can make her incredibly effective, particularly in content with multiple weak enemies, thanks to her signature "Kuru Kuru" talent. If you want to see this adorable puppet spin her way to victory and clear waves of foes with ease, understanding how to build her correctly is key.

## Understanding Herta's Core Kit

Herta's kit revolves around her AoE capabilities and her unique Talent.

### Skill: One-Hit Wonder

Her Skill deals Ice damage to all enemies, a straightforward AoE hit that helps set up her Talent.

### Ultimate: It's Magic

A high-multiplier AoE Ice damage attack. While potent, her Talent is often the more consistent source of damage against large groups.

### Talent: Kindred Spirit

This is Herta's bread and butter for farming. When an enemy's HP drops to 50% or below after an attack by an ally, Herta launches a follow-up attack dealing AoE Ice Damage. This can be triggered multiple times in a single turn across different enemies, leading to cascade reactions against large groups of weak foes.

### Technique: Fine Arts

Deals AoE Ice Damage at the start of a battle. Useful for initiating combat and potentially triggering her Talent immediately against weaker enemies.

## The Optimal Herta Build: Relics & Ornaments

Equipping Herta with the right gear is crucial for maximizing her damage output, especially the frequency and impact of her follow-up attacks.

### Recommended Relic Sets

For Herta, you generally want sets that boost her Ice damage or her follow-up attack damage.

*   **4-piece Hunter of Glacial Forest:** This set is excellent for boosting her Ice damage and provides a Crit DMG boost after using her Ultimate. As her main damage comes from Ice, this is often a top choice.
*   **4-piece The Ashblazing Grand Duke:** If you're *heavily* focusing on maximizing her follow-up damage, this set provides ATK increase for each follow-up attack and boosts follow-up damage. It synergizes directly with her Talent.
*   **2-piece combinations:** Mixing 2-piece Hunter of Glacial Forest (Ice DMG) with 2-piece Musketeer of Wild Wheat (ATK%) or 2-piece The Ashblazing Grand Duke (ATK%) can also be viable depending on substats.

### Recommended Planar Ornament Sets

These sets from the Simulated Universe provide crucial stat boosts.

*   **Inert Salsotto:** A prime choice for Herta. It increases Crit Rate and, crucially, boosts Ultimate and Follow-up Attack DMG by 15% when Crit Rate reaches 50% or higher. This directly buffs her two main damage sources.
*   **Space Sealing Station:** A solid alternative that provides a straightforward ATK% increase if you meet the Speed requirement. Good if you need a general damage boost.

### Key Stats to Prioritize

Here's what you should look for on your gear pieces:

*   **Body:** Crit Rate or Crit DMG (depending on your sub-stats and desired balance)
*   **Feet:** ATK% or Speed (Speed helps her act more often, ATK% directly boosts damage)
*   **Planar Sphere:** Ice DMG Boost
*   **Link Rope:** ATK% or Energy Regeneration Rate (ERR can help her use her Ultimate more often)

**Sub-stats:** Prioritize Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK%, and Speed.

## Light Cones for Herta

Choosing the right Light Cone further enhances Herta's damage capabilities.

### Best Options

*   **The Day The Cosmos Fell (Herta's Signature LC):** While not a 5-star, this Light Cone is tailor-made for her. It's available for free from the Simulated Universe store and superimposing it is very accessible. It boosts the wearer's DMG for every enemy on the field, stacking up to 5 times, which is perfect for her AoE focus.
*   **Before Dawn (Jing Yuan's Signature 5-star):** A top-tier stat stick for any Erudition character, offering Crit DMG, Skill/Ultimate DMG, and a follow-up damage boost. If you happen to have it and aren't using it on Jing Yuan, Herta benefits greatly.
*   **Geniuses' Repose (4-star):** Increases ATK and Crit DMG for a few turns after defeating an enemy. Synergizes well with Herta's ability to quickly defeat multiple low-HP targets, triggering her Talent.

### Accessible Options

*   **Data Bank (3-star):** A simple option early on, boosting Ultimate DMG. Replace quickly.
*   **Passkey (3-star):** Provides Energy Regeneration after using Skill or Ultimate. Can help get her Ultimate faster.
