# Monopoly GO Partner Event: Your Guide to Teamwork and Treasure!

The Monopoly GO! Partner Event is one of the most anticipated and rewarding events in the game, bringing players together to build magnificent creations and earn incredible prizes. Unlike standard solo events, this requires collaboration with up to four different partners, combining your efforts (and dice rolls!) to hit milestones on shared progress bars. Successfully navigating these events can feel challenging, especially coordinating with others, but the rewards – ranging from copious dice rolls and sticker packs to exclusive tokens and profile frames – make the effort more than worthwhile. This guide will break down how to master the **Monopoly GO partner event** and maximize your chances of success with your chosen allies.

## Understanding the Partner Event Mechanics

When a Partner Event begins, four slots appear on your board, each representing a building or creation you need to complete with a partner.

### Finding the Right Partner

Choosing your partners is crucial. You can invite friends or let the game suggest partners. Ideally, select players you know are active and reliable. A good partner is someone who will contribute their fair share of points towards your shared goal. Communication (even just seeing them actively playing) is key!

### Earning Event Tokens

To contribute to your shared projects, you need event-specific tokens (e.g., 'Cakes', 'Puzzles', 'Gift Boxes'). These tokens appear on spaces on the main Monopoly GO board. Landing on these spaces awards you tokens, often multiplied by your current dice roll multiplier. The higher your multiplier, the more tokens you get per landed space.

### Spinning the Partner Wheel

Once you have tokens, you use them on a special "Partner Wheel" for each individual project. Spending tokens (e.g., 20, 200, 400, up to 2500+ per spin) spins the wheel, adding points to your shared progress bar with that specific partner. The higher the token value you spend, the more points you're likely to get per spin, and the faster you'll reach milestones.

## Strategies for Success in Partner Events

Teamwork makes the dream work, but smart individual play is also vital.

### Communication and Coordination

If possible, communicate with your partners (via in-game features or external apps like Discord). Agree on contribution goals (e.g., each partner aims for half the total points) and check in on each other's progress. If one partner is struggling, the other might need to pick up the slack, or you might need to gently find a new partner if they are inactive.

### Resource Management is Key

Partner Events are major dice sinks. Earning enough tokens often requires high dice multipliers. This means you'll burn through dice much faster than in solo events. Carefully manage your dice, saving them for High Roller modes or when you are likely to land on token spaces multiple times using strategic multipliers. Don't exhaust all your dice on regular board progression just before an event starts.

### Leverage Other Events

Partner Events usually run concurrently with other events (like solo events or tournaments). Winning prizes from these concurrent events, especially dice rolls and sticker packs, can significantly boost your ability to earn tokens and contribute to your partner projects. Time your pushes to align with these overlapping rewards.

## Overcoming Challenges: The Need for Resources

One of the biggest hurdles in a **Monopoly GO partner event** is simply running out of dice or the ability to earn enough tokens to complete your share, especially if a partner isn't contributing equally. Feeling stuck because you lack the resources to help your partner or finish that final project can be frustrating. This is where having access to more dice or in-game currency becomes crucial for many players who want to ensure they complete the event and claim the valuable rewards. For players looking for a reliable way to quickly acquire the dice, shield boosts, or bundles needed to power through the event milestones and be the best partner they can be, exploring options for [Monopoly GO top-ups](https://www.playsave.gg/) can provide a much-needed advantage.

| Milestone Points | Example Rewards (Varies per Event) |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1,000 - 5,000    | Dice Rolls (Small amounts), Sticker Packs (Green/Yellow) |
