Master the Tower: The Definitive Solo Farming Guide for Mobile RPG Enthusiasts
Why Solo Tower Farming Is a Game-Changer
Solo farming in the tower isn’t just about racking up resources—it’s a chance to sharpen your skills, test your builds, and enjoy uninterrupted gameplay at your own pace. Whether you’re after rare crafting materials or aiming to climb the leaderboards, running the tower alone offers flexibility no co-op run can match.

Pre-Run Checklist
Before you dive in, make sure you’ve ticked off the essentials:

Stamina Boosts
Top up your account at PlaySave.gg to grab premium stamina potions—every extra run counts.

Character Power Level
Aim for at least level 80 on your main DPS to breeze through early floors.

Gear Optimization
Equip the right weapons and artifacts (see table below) to maximize damage and survivability.


Item Category	Recommended Gear	Why It Matters
Primary Weapon	Gale Rod (5★)	High crit rate and elemental bonus
Artifact Set	Windwalker ×4	Boosts single-target DPS by 25%
Consumable Buff	Potion of Swiftness	+15% attack speed for 5 minutes

Top Solo Farming Strategies
1. Route Efficiency
Start at Floor 12: Fast clear time with optimal mob density.

Loop Back to Floor 8: Higher rare drop rates early in the day.

End on Boss Floor: Guaranteed Epic-tier loot drop.

2. Time Your Runs
00:00–01:00 UTC: Server resets often trigger bonus spawn rates.

Any Low-Traffic Window: Fewer lag issues and smoother animations.

3. Build Synergy
Pair your DPS with a buffer/healer for sustained runs.

Rotate artifacts mid-week based on upcoming tower modifiers.

Advanced Tips for Veteran Players
Micro-Adjust Your Gear: Swap in that 5★ crit ring when facing tougher minibosses.

Exploit Daily Buffs: Check the daily event schedule—some buffs stack with your artifacts.

Track Your Stats: Use an in-game spreadsheet or note app to log drop rates and clear times over a week; small tweaks lead to big gains.
