## Beyond Codes: Securing More Resources

While **Nikke codes** are fantastic freebies that provide valuable boosts, the demand for resources in Goddess of Victory: Nikke for pulling new characters, limit breaking, and upgrading Nikkes and equipment can be immense, especially as you progress into the later stages of the game or when a must-have limited Nikke is available. Free codes, while helpful, often provide only a fraction of the resources needed to consistently pull on banners or rapidly power up your team. Farming in-game content takes time and Trailblaze Power. For Commanders who want to accelerate their progress, acquire more Recruit Vouchers for those crucial pulls, or quickly obtain Gems to secure advantages or unlock specific content, acquiring in-game currency is a common approach. If you're looking for a reliable and secure way to get the extra resources you need to strengthen your roster and conquer challenging content in Nikke, considering [Nikke top-ups](https://www.playsave.gg/) can be a strategic option.
