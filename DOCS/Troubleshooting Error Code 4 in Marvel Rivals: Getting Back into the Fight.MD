*   **Server Status:** Issues on the game server's end.
*   **Client/Game File Corruption:** Problems with your local game installation.
*   **Authentication/Login Issues:** Problems verifying your account status.

Let's look at some steps you can take to try and fix it.

## Basic Troubleshooting Steps

Start with the simplest solutions, as they often resolve the problem quickly.

### Check Marvel Rivals Server Status

Before troubleshooting your own system, verify if the game servers are operational.
*   Look for official announcements on Marvel Rivals' social media channels (Twitter, Discord) or official forums.
*   Check community-run status websites if available.
*   If servers are down or experiencing issues, you'll likely need to wait for the developers to fix them.

### Verify Your Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is crucial for online games.
*   Ensure your Wi-Fi is stable or consider using a wired Ethernet connection.
*   Restart your router and modem.
*   Test your internet speed and stability using online tools.

## Game and System-Specific Fixes

If your internet is fine and servers are online, the issue might be on your end.

### Restart the Game and Launcher

Close Marvel Rivals completely, including any associated game launchers (like Steam or the dedicated client). Then, restart the launcher and the game. This can clear temporary glitches.

### Verify Integrity of Game Files

Game files can sometimes become corrupted or go missing, leading to errors.
*   If using Steam, right-click Marvel Rivals in your library -> Properties -> Installed Files -> Verify integrity of game files.
*   If using a different launcher, look for a similar "Verify," "Repair," or "Scan and Repair" option for Marvel Rivals.

### Check for Game Updates

Ensure your game client is the latest version. Outdated versions can sometimes fail to connect to updated servers. Launchers usually handle this automatically, but it's worth double-checking.

### Restart Your PC

A classic fix, but restarting your computer can resolve conflicts or processes interfering with the game.

### Check Firewall and Antivirus Settings

Your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking Marvel Rivals from connecting to the internet.
*   Ensure Marvel Rivals and its launcher are allowed through your Windows Firewall.
*   Temporarily disable your antivirus (at your own risk) to see if it's the cause, then add an exception for the game if it resolves the issue.
