# Urgot Counters: How to Outplay the Dreadnought in Wild Rift

Urgot, the Dreadnought, is a formidable force in the Baron Lane of Wild Rift. Known for his oppressive laning phase, surprising tankiness, automatic targeting from Purge (W), powerful engage with Disdain (E), and executing ultimate (Fear Beyond Death R), he can be a nightmare to face if you don't know his weaknesses. While seemingly a juggernaut in the right hands, Urgot has specific vulnerabilities that good players can exploit. Understanding **Urgot counters** is key to turning this scary crab into just another defeated enemy on the Rift.

## Understanding What Makes Urgot Strong (and Where He's Weak)

Before we dive into countering him, let's quickly look at his kit to see where the threats lie and where the opportunities to strike back are.

### Urgot's Strengths:

*   **Durability:** His passive shield and innate tankiness make him hard to burst down.
*   **Consistent Damage:** Purge (W) provides reliable, high auto-targeting damage once activated.
*   **Engage/Disruption:** Disdain (E) is a dash that flips targets behind him, crucial for setting up kills.
*   **Execute Potential:** Fear Beyond Death (R) can finish off low-health enemies from a distance and provides powerful crowd control if the execute is successful.

### Urgot's Exploitable Weaknesses:

*   **Predictable Engage:** Disdain (E) is telegraphed and has a relatively long cooldown early on. If he misses or uses it defensively, he's exposed.
*   **Reduced Mobility with W:** While Purge (W) gives him damage, it significantly slows him down, making him easier to kite or outmaneuver during its duration.
*   **Reliant on E:** His core combo (E > W) relies on landing Disdain. Dodging it largely negates his primary threat window.
*   **Vulnerable After E:** Once Disdain is on cooldown, he lacks a quick escape or engage tool.

## General Counterplay Strategies Against Urgot

These tips apply regardless of which champion you're playing. Master these fundamentals to improve your chances against Urgot.

### Dodge His Disdain (E)

This is paramount. Urgot *wants* to land his E to flip you, apply his passive shotgun knees, and activate his W for maximum damage. Practice sidestepping this dash. If he misses, you have a significant window (especially early game) to trade or disengage safely.

### Trade *After* He Uses Disdain (E)

Whether he misses, uses E to escape (less common, but happens), or engages onto your teammate, the moment his E is on cooldown is your chance. Without his flip, his kill pressure drops significantly. Punish his positioning during this vulnerability.

### Respect the Execute (R)

Keep an eye on your health bar against Urgot. If you're below the execute threshold (indicated by a line on your HP bar), play extremely cautiously. Be aware of his position. If he casts his ultimate on you, be ready to use any available mobility (Flash, dashes) or invulnerability (Stasis Enchant, certain champion abilities) to survive the pull.

### Kite During His Purge (W)

When Urgot activates his W, he walks slower but rapid-fires. If you are a mobile champion or have a dash/blink available, use it to create distance while his W is active. Don't stand still and trade auto-attacks unless you are certain you win the all-in *despite* his W damage. Wait for W to end before re-engaging.

## Champion Picks That Excel Against Urgot

Certain champions in Wild Rift are inherently better suited to handle Urgot's kit due to their own abilities.

### Mobile Duelists

Champions with dashes or blinks can easily dodge or re-position after Urgot's E or kite him during W. Examples include **Fiora** (can Riposte his E or even his R pull) and **Vayne** (Tumble to dodge, Condemn to push him away, percentage damage is good against his HP).

### Champions with Strong CC

Locking Urgot down after he commits with E can allow your team to burst him.
Examples: **Malphite** (Ultimate can engage onto Urgot or lock him down), **Gragas** (Body Slam E, Ultimate).

### Sustain and Tankiness

Champions that can out-sustain his damage or are simply too tanky for him to effectively execute.
Examples: **Garen** (Silence interrupts his W/R setup, sustain from Passive), **Darius** (Healing from Q, true damage R to match his execute - often a skill matchup).

### Specific Ability Counters

*   **Jax:** His Counter Strike (E) can dodge Urgot's W damage and stun him if he gets close, also potentially dodging the E flip.

Here's a quick look at champion types and why they work:

| Champion Archetype | Why They Counter Urgot                        | Examples (Wild Rift)        |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Mobile Duelist** | Can dodge E, kite W, re-engage effectively  | Fiora, Vayne, Yasuo (skill) |
| **Heavy CC**       | Lock down Urgot after his commitment          | Malphite, Gragas, Blitzcrank |
| **High Sustain**   | Can out-heal his damage over time             | Garen, Nasus (scaling)      |
| **Specific Immunity/Dodge** | Abilities that specifically counter parts of his kit | Fiora (Riposte), Jax (Counter Strike) |

## Itemization: Build Smart Against the Crab

Building the right defensive items significantly reduces Urgot's kill pressure. Prioritize **Armor** items.

*   **Plated Steelcaps:** Excellent early boots for reducing damage from his rapid-fire W.
*   **Randuin's Omen:** Reduces Crit Damage (though less critical vs Urgot than ADCs), but the Active Slow and Passive Attack Speed reduction are valuable against his W.
*   **Dead Man's Plate:** Provides Armor, HP, and out-of-combat speed. The empowered auto-attack after moving can also be useful for trades.
*   **Sterak's Gage:** If you're a bruiser, the shield and Tenacity can save you from his ultimate's execute pull.
